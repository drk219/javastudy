In Java, the string constant pool is a pool of strings stored in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). 
When you create a string using double quotes in Java, it's stored in the string constant pool. 
The string constant pool has a significant impact on memory efficiency because it allows the JVM to reuse existing strings rather than creating new instances for identical string literals. 
This is possible because strings in Java are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed after they are created. 
As a result, the JVM can safely reuse the same string instance in different parts of the program.

String타입은 가급적 자주 바꾸지 않는것이 좋다
